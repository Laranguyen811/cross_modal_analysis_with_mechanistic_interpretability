## ViT Mice 🐭
ViT Mice are the mini-versions of the standard Vision Transformers, serving as our experimental subjects. By training these mice on both toy datasets and in-the-wild data, we aim to observe their behaviors in various environments. This approach helps us understand the strengths and limitations of ViTs in controlled vs. real-world settings.

**Why "Mice"?**
Just as mice are often used in scientific experiments for their manageable size, our ViT Mice serve a similar purpose in the machine learning domain. 

**Categories of Mice** 
1. **Toy Data Mice:** Trained on controlled, often synthetic, datasets to understand specific behaviors or to isolate certain aspects of the learning process.
2. **In-the-Wild Mice:** Trained on naturalistic, real-world data reminiscent of models in-production.

_To train_
* ImageNet-1k Mice
